# EcIA
# This is the GitHub repository for my Ecological Impact Assessment Coursework

# Study system: Lochranza, Arran
# A landowner has two sites: Site A (south) and Site B (north) and wants one site put forward for ecological restoration
# This repository contains raw data from the field surveys and the code generated to visualise it
# Majority of code is for diversity indices (richness, shannon and beta) and bar plots to represent the data
